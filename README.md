#  LeetCode-SQL-50 ⚡

Welcome to the **LeetCode-SQL-50** repository! This project documents my journey of solving one SQL problem from LeetCode every day for the next 50 days. 🚀

## 🌟 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to leveling up my SQL skills by tackling one SQL problem from LeetCode each day. The journey starts on 09/07/2024 and will continue for 50 consecutive days. Each solution will be documented and stored in this repository, along with the problem description and my approach to solving it. 💪

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── Day_1
│   ├── problem.md
│   └── solution.sql
├── Day_2
│   ├── problem.md
│   └── solution.sql
...
├── Day_50
    ├── problem.md
    └── solution.sql
    
```

- Each day's folder contains:
  - `problem.md`: 📜 The problem statement from LeetCode.
  - `solution.sql`: 💾 My SQL solution to the problem.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To view the solutions, navigate to the corresponding day's folder and open the `solution.sql` file.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run the SQL queries, you will need access to a SQL database. I recommend using:

- `MySQL`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `SQLite`

Ensure that you have a basic understanding of SQL and how to execute SQL queries in your chosen database.

### 💡 Running the Solutions

1. Copy the content of the `solution.sql` file for the respective day.
2. Open your SQL database management tool.
3. Execute the query to see the results.
